# PUZZLES

This is a repository I created for playing with or tackling some of the challenging but exciting
Math and Computer science problems. 

Some of these problems remains unsolved up to this time.

## 1. Nqueens challenge

This problems asks the number of ways to arrange N queens in N * N chessboard
so that none of them attack each other.

Some people tried to find a formula for computing the number of ways to arrange `K`
queens in a specific `X * X` chessboard. After conducting a research, I found that, up to this time, 
none has found a Mathematical solution that generalises for all `N * N` chessboards. Moreover, even many of the
computer science solutions run out of memory for larger values of `N`. For instance, with my python solution,
my laptop can solve up to N = 9, and when I paste it into a little bit advanced online server like W3schools, it computes up to
N = 11 (if you know a more advanced online compiler, you are welcome to let me know to test its limit too).

Hopefully, by the time I will implement the algorithm with a more efficient languages like C or C++ and optimize
memory through dynamic memory allocation, the computers will be able to solve for higher values of N.
